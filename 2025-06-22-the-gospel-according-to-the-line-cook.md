Before I translated scope into milestone, I plated pressure on the line.

I’ve worked the trenches of food service, routing orders, forecasting demand, and multitasking at warp nine—all while helping a new hire find the gloves. I didn’t learn to “handle pressure.” I learned to season it, reduce it down, and serve it with a vinaigrette of strategic grace.

In stadiums, I managed AV where a mistimed mic check could implode morale. Food and beverage logistics? Coordinated under tighter windows than a boardroom budget. I optimized prep flows with the precision of a DevOps pipeline and delivered customer-centric service with jazz hands.

Every plate was a process. Every POS meltdown was an opportunity to reroute. Every handheld club-level device? A crucible of Bluetooth despair I mastered through ritual, reboot, and sheer will.

That was my Six Sigma dojo. That was where I became a stakeholder whisperer with a ladle.
