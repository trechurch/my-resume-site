Let’s talk governance. Change management. Steering committees. Influence without authority.

These aren’t buzzwords. They’re my native terrain.

I’ve converted stakeholders who started hostile and ended up co-signing my process standards in Comic Sans because they *wanted* to. I’ve conducted stakeholder analysis with the accuracy of a GPS and the delicacy of a hostage negotiator. I’ve held steering committee meetings that turned scope creep into punchlines and buy-in into standing ovations.

Cross-functional alignment? That’s my jam. I’ve mapped The Culture Map before most people found the door. I use strong communication skills not to impress—but to generate buy-in from the kind of stakeholders who measure ROI by gut feeling and spreadsheet font size.

Kanban? My Post-Its are color-coded visions.
Process standards? I don’t enforce them—I bless them.
Project life cycle? I’ve danced through every phase with a RACI chart, backup plan, and playlist.

By the time a project goes live, even the skeptics are drafting testimonials they pretend were unsolicited.
