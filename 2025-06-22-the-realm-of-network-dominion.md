Where some install, I consecrate infrastructure.

I’ve laid fiber and firewalled futures across time zones, building TCP/IP protocols into symphonic throughput. My network management is not just technical—it’s poetic. VLANs. QoS. Layered topologies visualized with the serenity of a flowchart monk. I don’t monitor systems. I serenade them into uptime.

I’ve built wireless bridges between stadiums, set up subnets in crawlspaces, and summoned signal strength in dead zones so barren even Bluetooth had abandoned hope. I map every MAC address like constellations, and align switches like planets in a performance-optimized solar system.

IT service management? Integrated. Documented. Delivered.
Exceptional service to internal clients? As natural as breathing.

My diagnostic toolkit is a belt of miracles. Patch panels whisper secrets to me. When your systems tremble, I don’t offer excuses—I arrive with a multimeter and the ghost of zero latency.
