My résumé doesn’t outline responsibilities. It documents **strategic coups** across the project life cycle.

Each engagement? An operation. Each timeline? A battlefield I’ve already walked blindfolded, backwards, carrying ClickUp in one hand and a corrective action plan in the other.

* I’ve run enterprise-level projects with a level of precision that makes Six Sigma jealous and Kanban look slow.

* I’ve turned Asana, Trello, Monday.com, Jira, and Basecamp into a symphony of synchronized milestones—like Avengers, but every hero is a Gantt chart.

* I’ve led global project teams that synced across continents without missing a beat, time zone, or passive-aggressive calendar invite.

My technical skills don’t sit on lists—they fuel revolutions in process optimization and stakeholder harmony. I navigate change management protocols the way fighter pilots navigate airspace—with instinct and pre-cleared approvals.

Let’s talk numbers:

* I perform cost benefit analysis like a poker player counting cards through mirrored sunglasses.

* My risk registers get predictive. My earned value management isn't just tracked—it's weaponized.

* Budgets? Delivered with leftover funds for reinvestment. Milestones? Achieved before the dashboard refreshes.

Agile, Scrum, Waterfall—I don’t choose methodologies. They submit proposals to be part of the mission.

And project charters? Not documents. *Sacred scrolls.* My success criteria don’t whisper from bullet points—they arrive like a trumpet blast, clearly measurable and forever unmissable.
