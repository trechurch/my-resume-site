Dear Future Employer,
This is not a résumé. This is a calibrated payload of potential. A tactical broadcast from the outer rim of what enterprise technology thinks is possible.

I’m not applying. I’m activating.

I am the post-certification convergence of global infrastructure, stakeholder orchestration, and caffeine-fueled tactical serenity. I hold IT project management certifications like access keys, wield governance like a brushstroke, and lead with a customer-centric approach so smooth it could double as jazz.

I bring executive summaries with teeth. Steering committee presentations that induce applause. Project artifacts so pristine they deserve their own gallery exhibit in Smartsheet. Want buy-in from stakeholders across time zones, departments, and mood boards? Done. I speak fluent RACI and can conduct stakeholder analysis with nothing but a glance and a whiteboard marker that smells faintly of legend.

I’ve stood in the chaos of undefined scope and whispered, “Not today.”
I’ve stared down the triple constraint model, crossed my arms, and said, “Try me.”
And OKRs? They don’t just get met—they get memorialized.

What follows isn’t work experience. It’s an operational symphony of infrastructure, insight, and the kind of communication skills that turn executives into evangelists.
