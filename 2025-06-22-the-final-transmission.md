This isn’t ambition. This is a cosmic alignment of strategy, service, and slightly dangerous levels of enthusiasm for well-labeled patch panels.

You can hire someone competent. Or you can hire an orchestrator of operational legacy—who knows how to lead SMEs through product roadmaps, explain TCP/IP to non-tech execs without causing panic, and deploy project timelines in tools so well-configured they make Microsoft Project blush.

My toolkit includes EVM, Smartsheet, ClickUp, Gantt charts, and—when necessary—jazz hands. I communicate across org charts, forecast success criteria like weather patterns, and deploy with the calm swagger of a DevOps monk.

Project Launch? Prepped like a Falcon 9.
Project Landing? Softer than a freshly rebooted dashboard.
Constraints? Assumptions? Risks? Let’s make ’em flinch.

Let’s not "connect." Let’s mobilize.
Let’s not "schedule a call." Let’s recalibrate your infrastructure for legend.
Let’s not "interview." Let’s shift the paradigm.
